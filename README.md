# Password_Manager
password_manager with login System in C++

This is just the Beginner's Project in C++.

In this I used the concept of OOP + File Handling to develop this Program.

We are using SignUp System for a new User and storing his/her details in a file.
If the user already exists then we are reteriving details from the file.

Here the main Idea behind yhis Concept is 

In the RealWorld Senario we all do SignUps in many different Websites and forget the passwords,Username,etc...
So , In order to OverCome this kind of Situations we develop this model to stre all your information in a file.

Step 1 : SignUp if you are new User or Login.
Step 2 : Store your Desired Infromation.
Step 3 : Reterive information whenever you want.

Thst's All.
